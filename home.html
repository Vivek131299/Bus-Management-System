                <h3>OUR MOTIVE</h3>
                <p id="paragraph">The main objective of this measure is to build a common platform for integrated
                     monitoring and passenger information services. <br>By gathering relevant information 
                     from drivers and operators attitudes towards the system, the measure can improve 
                     the quality and reliability of the transport services which will lead to better 
                     acceptance and usage of these services by citizens.<br> As part of this measure a GPS 
                     traffic management system has been introduced.<br> The system has been set up to track 
                     public transport vehicles, and this information has been used to prioritise and 
                     optimise Public Transport, making it more attractive to users.
